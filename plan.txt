About me

Problem definition
- development environment configuration
- server resource utilization
- predictable deployments

Let's focus on the first one

Previous approaches
- no separation at all, everyone was responsible for preparation and management of his own environment (gif)
- virtual machines - still not automated, or used Vagrant (iteration cycle, overhead)

It was not perfect - when one person updated something, others had to do it manually on their machines
Hard & painful onboarding
Mess when working with multiple projects
Slow prototyping
